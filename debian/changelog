m3ugen (0.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Converting to native debian package in subversion. From this point will
    handle source tarballs by dereferencing the changelog symlink and deleting
    debian/ before rolling the tarball.
  * Added a bunch of necessary files to debian/ (compat control copyright dirs
    docs README.Debian rules)

m3ugen (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a check to see if the disc tag is supported by the underlying
    library. If not, $disc is set to "undef" (which is the same value it would
    get if the modified version of Audio::File couldn't read a disc property
    for that particular file.)
  * Updated copyright.

m3ugen (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the REAL 0.16. Not to be confused with the fake 0.15 that was 0.15
    except that it wasn't... (see commit 16 for details)
  * Fixed a bug that would cause an empty playlist to get created if -a was
    specified along with an output file. You'll now get a warning and some
    halfway intelligent behavior.
  * A lot mote UTF8 cleanup stuff. I've pulled out most of the explicit
    handling, choosing instead to let Perl do whatever it thinks is best. We
    just convert the text that's going to be written to the file to UTF8 and
    let Perl and the OS decide amongst themselves how to handle all of the
    file-related stuff.
  * Removed some redundant code that didn't really do anything.
  * Added a few additional debugging messages that I needed while doing all of
    the above stuff.

m3ugen (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the version that 0.14 should have been, had I done more work on
    it. But as I've been in the teens for a long time with versioning, I
    figured this was a good time to make some progress.
  * Fixed some of the UTF8 handling code. Turns out that decode_utf8 doesn't
    like being passed strings which are already OK. So we now have the
    mkvalidutf subroutine to take care of that for us.
  * Fixed a bug with some filenames not being handled properly. (We were
    checking for valid UTF8 in a filename AFTER trying to open it... whoops.)
  * Added the --stdebug option. Same as --debug, except it prints to STDOUT.
    (I got tired of doing m3ugen -d somedir 2>&1 |less)
  * Cleaned up the debugging code to provide information about what's being
    found and what's being used to be a bit more compact and to make a bit
    more sense (I hope).
  * Created an "intelligent" separator line. It's made up of as many dashes as
    can fit on the current width of the terminal.
  * Cleaned out some old comments.

m3ugen (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to use File::Basename instead of old hacked together string
    comparisons.
  * Fixed a few outstanding utf8-related bugs.
  * Fixed a bug that caused multiple #EXTM3U lines to get written if you were
    putting more than one album into a single playlist.

m3ugen (0.13-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added standard COPYING, INSTALL, AUTHORS, and TODO files, preparing for a
    tarball.

m3ugen (0.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added man page
  * Added a symlink from debian/changelog to changelog, in case any non-Debian
    users get confused. I think that for the next release I may just make it
    into a proper Debian package.

m3ugen (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added pattern functionality for M3U info lines. See 'm3ugen --help'
  * Cleaned up the --help screen a bit.

m3ugen (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improved UTF-8 support. All filehandles are now explicitly opened as UTF-8.
  * Added a requirement for Encode (one of the base Perl modules) to handle UTF-8 strings.
  * Added the -v flag to show the current version of m3ugen.
  * First version to be committed to new SVN repository.

m3ugen (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * Why, is this a Debian changelog? Yes, yes it is. But this isn't a Debian package? No, no it's not. But I use a Debian system, and since Debian already has these wonderfully helpful tools written for me already, why not use them?
