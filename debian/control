Description: Simple m3u playlist generator
 m3ugen is a simple m3u playlist generator. Itâ€™s written in Perl and
 supports FLAC, MP3, and Ogg Vorbis format tags, though additional formats
 can be added by simply extending Audio::File (libaudio-file-perl in Debian).
 .
 m3ugen will scan a directory (identified by source) and all media files in
 it, and then generate a playlist sorted by disc number (if available) and
 track number.
